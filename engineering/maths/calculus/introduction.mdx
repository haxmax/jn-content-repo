## Introduction
Welcome to this course of basics of Calculus. You will find this course very interesting as this course has almost no mugging concepts. We will see that it is just like fourth standard mathematics, once you master it you can solve the question in minimum time.

## What is calculus
Calculus is that branch of mathematics in which we study about continuous change in the values of a function. If we look around ourselves there is a variety of data that keeps changing continuously over time for example our age, our bank balance etc. So to put it simply, calculus means studying functions of time.
The concepts of calculus, earlier known as infinitesimal calculus, were developed by Sir Issac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany while working independently on different topics in the mid-17th century.

Calculus is broadly divided into two branches â€“ Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus.
