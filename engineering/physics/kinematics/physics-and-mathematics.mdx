This article is about revising important concepts related to use of mathematics in physics. It is very important to understand concepts. You will find basic formulas which you should know.

## Vectors and Scalars.
Scalars are the quantities which can be described by magnitude.
While vectors can be described by magnitude and direction.

Mathematically we discribe vectors with $\widehat{a}$ 

### Operations of vectors and scalars.
    - Additions

    - Equality of vectors
    - Multiplication of Vectors by a number
    - Substraction
    - Dot product of vectors
    - Cross product of vectors
    Why do we need dot and cross product?

## Calculus and Graphs
In mathematics, almost every thing can be written as function. e.g a straight line can be function($ax+by=c$), if we include time on a axis we can express a motion of a object in 2d or 3d as function. Some function involve real number like (a,b,c in examples of straight line) while some contains imaginary number which is out of scope this course.

Most of functions can be repersented on Graphs. 

Calculus is a tool to do some 


### Differential Calculus

Why do we need this stuff. Some relations with real world examples.


### Integral Calculus
Why do we need this stuff. 
How area under the curve is important. Is it related with real world phenomena.

### Significant digits 

### ✋ Questions
