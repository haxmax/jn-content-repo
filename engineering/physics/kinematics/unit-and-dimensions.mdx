## Units

All physical quantities are measured w.r.t standard magnitude of the same physical quantity and these standards are called UNITS.


### Why units needs to be standarised.
To measure a physical quantity we need to standard unit of that quantity.
The measurement of physical quantity involves two parts.the
First part gives how many times of the standard unit and the second
Part gives the name of the unit.

In 1971 CGPM(Conference Generals des poids et Mesures) held its meeting and decided a system of units which is 
Known as International system of Units. It is abbreviated
as SI from the French name Le system International d' unites.


Fundamental quantities- All the physical quantities which can be treated as
Independent of other physical quantities and are not usually defined in 
terms of other physical quantities are called Fundamental quantities.
Fundamental quantities are also called base quantities.
Example- mass length ,time, electric current, temperature etc

Derived quantities- The physical quantities whose defining
Operations are based on other physical quantities are
called derived quantities. Example- velocity, acceleration.
Force etc.

Fundamental units- The units defined for the fundamental quantities are 
Called Fundamental units.

Derived units- All the other physical units which can be expressed
in terms of fundamental units are called derived units.

SI Prefix

Definition of Base units

- Meter:- The distance travelled by light in vaccum in 
1/299,792,458 second is called 1 mentre. It is the SI Unit 
Of length.

- Kilogram:-It is the SI Unit of mass.The mass of a cylinder made of
Platinum-iridium alloy kept at International Bureau of weights
and Measures is defined as 1 kg.

- Second:- It is the SI Unit of Time. The second is the duration of
9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to
the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the
ground state of the cesium-133 atom.

- Ampere:- It is SI Unit of electric current. If equal currents
are maintained in the two infinitely long wires of negligible cross-section,
so that the force between them is 2×10^-7 Newton per
metre of the wires, the current in any of the wires is called 1Ampere.  
  
- Kelvin:- It is the SI Unit of temperature. The fraction 1/273.16
of the thermodynamic temperature of triple point (solid, liquid,gas)
of water is called 1 Kelvin.

- Mole:-It is the SI Unit of amount of substance. The mole is the amount of a substance that contains
as many elementary entities as there are number of atoms in 0.012kg 
of carbon-12.

- Candela:- It is the SI Unit of luminous intensity.1 candela is the luminous
intensity of a blackbody of surface area 1/600,000m^2 placed
at the temperature of freezing platinum and at a pressure of
101,325N/m^2.

Apart from these seven base fundamental units, two supplementary units are also used:-
1. The plane angle is measured in Radian.
2. The solid angle is measured in steradian.

### Dimensions:- All the physical quantities of interest can be
derived from the base quantities."The power(exponent) of the base quantity that enters
into the expression of a physical quantity in that base.
