## Introduction

Welcome to physics Core in justnotes.in. This is an introductory chapter about our course in which you will know the defintion of basic entity of physics.

### Physics and nature

Lets start with an example to define science. Two player are playing chess while one person person who does not know the any rules of the game is observing them. After some time he tries to intellectually think and see some repetitions. He tries to link them and decode some rule. This is exactly same which happens to us everyday. Nature is the game and we humans are observers and through years of observations we have created some rules.

Thus we can define science as

```
The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study 
of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world
through observation and experiment.
```

Science has many divisions one is physics which deals with matter and energy and there interaction.

Lets define two basic entity of physics.

```
Matter: Any substance which has some mass and occupies space is matter.
```

All physical objects are composed of matter, in the form of atoms, which are in turn composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons

```
Energy is capacity to do work.
```
 Energy can exist in a variety of forms, such as electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, or nuclear, and can be transformed from one form to another.

From these basic entity five branches of physics has been developed.

### Branches of Physics

1. Mechanics
2. Thermodynamics
3. Waves and Optics
4. Electromagnetism
5. Modern Physics (Relativity and Quantum Mechanics)
