Earlier electron was thought of particle nature. Some scientiscts were able to demostrate the wave nature of electron. After sometime, Schrodinger uses the mathematical equation used in classical wave Theory of Physics to characterize the motion of electron around nucleus. Then Quantum mathematical model was developed to study nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. Quatum mechanics looks very complex however, when you able to visualize like a sound wave on a guitar string it becomes simple. Lets us use this to understand distribution of electron in an atom.

## Distribution of electrons in an atomic

Earlier electron was thought of particle nature. Later, it was realized that it has wave nature also. This wave nature was also validated with mathematical wave equation. This lead to proposal of mathematical model known as Quantum mechanics.

### Atomic orbitals
According to Schrodinger, the electrons in an atom can be thought of as occupying a set of concentric shells that surround the nucleus.
