Earlier electron was thought of particle nature. Some scientiscts were able to demostrate the wave nature of electron. After sometime, Schrodinger uses the mathematical equation used in classical wave Theory of Physics to characterize the motion of electron around nucleus. Then Quantum mathematical model was developed to study nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. Quatum mechanics looks very complex however, when you able to visualize like a sound wave on a guitar string it becomes simple. Lets us use this to understand distribution of electron in an atom.

## Distribution of electrons in an atomic

Earlier electron was thought of particle nature. Later, it was realized that it has wave nature also. This wave nature was also validated with mathematical wave equation. This lead to proposal of mathematical model known as Quantum mechanics.

### Atomic orbitals

According to Schrodinger, the electrons in an atom can be thought of as occupying a set of concentric shells that surround the nucleus. First shell is closest to nucleus, second shell is farther than first and third shell is farther than second shell and so on..

Each shell contains subshells known as **atomic orbitals**. Each atomic orbitals has different shape and energy and occupies different volume.

| Distribution of electrons in first four shell                                  |
|                       |First Shell| Second Shell  | Third Shell | Fourth shell |
|-----------------------|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
|Atomic orbitals        | s         | s,p           | s,p,d       | s,p,d,f      |
|No. of Atomic Orbitals | 1         | 1,3           | 1,3,5       | 1,3,5,7      |
|Max No. of electrons   | 2         | 8             | 18          | 32           |

Each shell contains one s orbital. Each p shell contains three degenerate p orbitals. Each d shell contains 5 degenerate shells and Each f shell contains 7 degenerate orbitals.

``` 
Degenerate orbitals are orbitals that have same energy.
```

Following three rules specifies which orbital will be occupied by electron.

### aufbau principle
An electron always goes into the available orbital with lowest energy.

Relative energies of atomic orbitals :
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 3d 

### pauli exclusion principle
Pauli exclusion principle states that 
    a. no more than two electron can occupy each atomic orbital and 
    b. the two electrons must be of opposite spin. 

### Hund's Rule       
    
Hund rule states that
when there are two or more atomic orbitals with the same energy, an electron will occupy an empty orbital before it will pair with another electron.
