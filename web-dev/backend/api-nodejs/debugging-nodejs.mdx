## Debugger

how a debugger works
How the debugger knows how to stop on a breakpoint?

The simplified answer is: When you put a break-point into the program, the debugger replaces your code at that point with a int3 instruction which is a software interrupt. As an effect the program is suspended and the debugger is called.

You have mainly three ways to debug a NodeJs Application.
Command line option is deprecated while debugger with GUI is more popular.

### Command Line Debugger

```bash
node debug  // deprecated now
node inspect
```

### Chrome Debugger

```bash
node --inspect
node --inspect-brk // same as node --inspect however, it breaks on first line of code.
```

Point to be noted as `node inspect` is a command line debugger while `node --inspect` is graphical interface debugger

For debugging we need to understand following points.

- adding break point
- adding watches
- Call Stack

black box feature of chrome Debugger

When you will add any script to blackbox then debugger will not pause in that script. Adding script can be done in call stack windows in chrome developer tools.

## VS Code Debugger
VS Code has built-in debugging support for the Node.js runtime and can debug JavaScript, TypeScript, or any other language that gets transpiled to JavaScript.

To bring up the Run view, select the Run icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

### Launch configurations
To run or debug a simple app in VS Code, select Run and Debug on the Debug start view or press `F5` and VS Code will try to run your currently active file.

However, for most debugging scenarios, creating a launch configuration file is beneficial because it allows you to configure and save debugging setup details. VS Code keeps debugging configuration information in a launch.json file located in a .vscode folder in your workspace (project root folder) or in your user settings or workspace settings.

To create a launch.json file, click the create a launch.json file link in the Run start view.
