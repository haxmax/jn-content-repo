## Debugger

how a debugger works
How the debugger knows how to stop on a breakpoint?

The simplified answer is: When you put a break-point into the program, the debugger replaces your code at that point with a int3 instruction which is a software interrupt. As an effect the program is suspended and the debugger is called.

You have mainly three ways to debug a NodeJs Application.
Command line option is deprecated while debugger with GUI is more popular.

### Command Line Debugger

```bash
node debug  // deprecated now
node inspect
```

### Chrome Debugger

```bash
node --inspect
node --inspect-brk // same as node --inspect however, it breaks on first line of code.
```

Point to be noted as `node inspect` is a command line debugger while `node --inspect` is graphical interface debugger

For debugging we need to understand following points.

- adding break point
- adding watches
- Call Stack

black box feature of chrome Debugger

When you will add any script to blackbox then debugger will not pause in that script. Adding script can be done in call stack windows in chrome developer tools.
