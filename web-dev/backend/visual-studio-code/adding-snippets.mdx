Snippets is very useful. Effective use increases productivity.

## Snippets

Many Snippets are available through extensions like "ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets".
These snippets reduce a lot of boiler plate code.

### Adding your own snippets

Adding your own snippets is very simple in vscode.

- Just type `Ctrl + Shift + P` is launch Command.
- Type `snippets` to search
- Select `Preferences: Configure User Snippets`
- Select `Javascript.json`

```
{
	// Snippets Example:
	 "Print to console": {
	 	"prefix": "log",
	 	"body": [
	 		"console.log('$1');",
	 		"$2"
	 	],
	 	"description": "Log output to console"
    }
}
```

Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:

`$1`, `$2` for tab stops, `$0` for the final cursor position, and `${1:label}`, `${2:another}` for placeholders.

Placeholders with the same ids are connected.

### Snippets using keyboard shortcuts

You can create custom keybindings to insert specific snippets. Open keybindings.json (Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts File), which defines all your keybindings, and add a keybinding passing "snippet" as an extra argument:

```
{
    "key": "cmd+k 1",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
    "snippet": "console.log($1)$0"
    }
}
```

The keybinding will invoke the Insert Snippet command but instead of prompting you to select a snippet, it will insert the provided snippet. You define the custom keybinding as usual with a keyboard shortcut, command ID, and optional when clause context for when the keyboard shortcut is enabled.
