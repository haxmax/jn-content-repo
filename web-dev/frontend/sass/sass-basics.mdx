## Css with superpower

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language for Css preprocessing.

### Installing Sass

Simplest way to use `Sass` is using `Live Sass Compiler` extension in vscode. This extension will compile Scss/Sass file to Css file and reload the browser.

### Variables

You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the \$ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:

SCSS Syntax

```scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

SASS Syntax

```sass
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color

```

CSS OUTPUT

```css
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```

When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the `$font-stack` and `$primary-color` and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.

> ⚠️ CSS has variables of its own, which are totally different than Sass variables. Know the differences!

- Css variable are inserted using function var(name, value) where name can be any selector while value is optional
- Sass variables are all compiled away by Sass. CSS variables are included in the CSS output.
- CSS variables can have different values for different elements, but Sass variables only have one value at a time.
- Sass variables are imperative, which means if you use a variable and then change its value, the earlier use will stay the same. CSS variables are declarative, which means if you change the value, it’ll affect both earlier uses and later uses.

> 💡 In sass `$font-size` and `$font_size` is same variable. This was done to solve compatibility issue as earlier sass does not include - in variable name

### Nesting

When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.

With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:

SCSS Syntax

```scss
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

Sass Syntax

```sass
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

CSS OUTPUT

```css
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it more readable.

### Partials

You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like \_partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.

### Modules

You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled output!

SCSS Syntax

```
// _base.scss
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}
```

Sass Syntax

```
// _base.sass
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color

// styles.sass
@use 'base'

.inverse
  background-color: base.$primary-color
  color: white
```

CSS output

```
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

.inverse {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}
```

Notice we're using @use 'base'; in the styles.scss file. When you use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is smart and will figure it out for you.

### Mixins

Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for transform.

SCSS SYNTAX

```
@mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
```

CSS OUTPUT

```css
.box {
  -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
  -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
  transform: rotate(30deg);
}
```

To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable \$property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin.

### Extend/Inheritance

This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.

SCSS Syntax

```
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}
```

What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, & .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.

You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.

Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because %equal-heights is never extended.

### Operators

Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, \*, /, and %.
