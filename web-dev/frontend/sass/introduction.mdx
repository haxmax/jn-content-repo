Sass is a stylesheet language which compile to CSS. Sass is a preprocessor.

## Why Sass

Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that's used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.

As variables were introduced lately in CSS. Something was needed to produce more organized code with less repetition and more reuse. This gap was filled with css preprocessor i.e. sass, less.

### Scss vs Sass vs Less

Sass is preprocessor based on `Ruby`. Sass has 2 syntaxes available:

- `Sass` itself (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) in .sass files
- `SCSS` (Sassy CSS) in .scss files, which is something halfway between regular CSS and Sass

The difference between Sass and SCSS is quite subtle. Both can be interchangeably used by importing each other. Every feature in Sass is available in both syntax. This means they are both same thing by same provider/vendor with different syntax.

However, `Less` is a preprocessor based on javascript. Less has almost all feature as available in Sass. Both have been around for several years and are simple to use.

This article is not about Sass only. However, you will learn basic features and syntax differences between all three.

### DRY code

Everything about Sass or Less is to provide tools to prevent repeating yourself in your code: it’s the DRY principle, which stands for Don’t repeat yourself.

- variables prevents repeating values
- nesting prevents repeating selectors
- mixins and extensions prevent repeating properties
