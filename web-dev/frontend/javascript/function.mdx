function is first class citizen in javascript

Global Execution context

call stack - maintains the order of execution context

## Function Borrowing (call, apply and bind)

Function borrowing allows us to use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that method and maintain it in two separate places.

It is accomplished through the use of `call()` , `apply()` or `bind()`. All these method explicitly set `this` on the method we are borrowing.

```js
let name = {
  company: "JustNotes.in",
  shortname: "JN",
}
printDetails = function (town, country) {
  console.log(
    this.company + " (" + this.shortname + "), " + town + ", " + country
  )
}

//name is assigned to `this` in function context
printDetails.call(name, "New Delhi", "India") //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
printDetails.apply(name, ["New Delhi", "India"]) //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
printDetails.bind(name, "New Delhi", "India")
printDetails() //calling the function          //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
```

- Call invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments one by one
- Apply invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
- Bind returns a new function, and you can invoke/call it anytime you want by invoking a function.

## Predefined functions

JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:

eval()
The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.

uneval()
The uneval() method creates a string representation of the source code of an Object.

isFinite()
The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.

isNaN()
The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(), as defined in ECMAScript 2015, or you can use typeof to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.

parseFloat()
The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.

parseInt()
The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).

decodeURI()
The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.

decodeURIComponent()
The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.

encodeURI()
The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

encodeURIComponent()
The encodeURIComponent() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).
