Function is a block of code used to design a particular task.
It helps us to reuse the code effectively. Function is first class citizen in javascript. In javascript, we can even assign a function to a variable, return a function and can even pass argument as a function.

# Arrow function

Arrow function is compact alternative to traditional function. It can be written in one line which makes code more concise and readable.

```js
// Traditional Function
function square(a) {
  return a * a
}

// Arrow Function Break Down

// 1. Remove the word "function"  and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket
(a) => {
  return a * a
}

// 2. Remove the body braces and word "return" -- the return is implied.
(a) => a * a

// 3. Remove the argument parentheses
(a) => a * a

// 4. Named arrow function

let square = (a) => a * a
square(5)
```

## syntax

```js
//Single line
param => expression
//More than one parameter
(param1, paramN) => expression
//more than one line
param => {
let a = 1;
return a + param;
}
```

> &#128161; Arrow function does not have binding to `this` and `supper`.
> Arrow function can't be used as constructors.

## Function Borrowing (call, apply and bind)

Function borrowing allows us to use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that method and maintain it in two separate places.

It is accomplished through the use of `call()` , `apply()` or `bind()`. All these method explicitly set `this` on the method we are borrowing.

```js
let name = {
  company: "JustNotes.in",
  shortname: "JN",
}
printDetails = function (town, country) {
  console.log(
    this.company + " (" + this.shortname + "), " + town + ", " + country
  )
}

//name is assigned to `this` in function context
printDetails.call(name, "New Delhi", "India") //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
printDetails.apply(name, ["New Delhi", "India"]) //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
printDetails.bind(name, "New Delhi", "India")
printDetails() //calling the function          //JustNotes.in (JN), New Delhi, India
```

- Call invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments one by one
- Apply invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
- Bind returns a new function, and you can invoke/call it anytime you want by invoking a function.

### Arrow function uses.

To return an object literal expression requires parentheses around expression:

> params => ({foo: "a"}) // returning the object {foo: "a"}

Rest parameters are supported:

> (a, b, ...r) => expression

Destructuring within params supported:

> ([a, b] = [10, 20]) => a + b; // result is 30  
> ({ a, b } = { a: 10, b: 20 }) => a + b; // result is 30

## Predefined functions

JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:

- eval()
  The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.

- uneval()
  The uneval() method creates a string representation of the source code of an Object.

- isFinite()
  The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.

- isNaN()
  The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(), as defined in ECMAScript 2015, or you can use typeof to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.

- parseFloat()
  The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.

- parseInt()
  The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).

- decodeURI()
  The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.

- decodeURIComponent()
  The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.

- encodeURI()
  The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

- encodeURIComponent()
  The encodeURIComponent() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).
