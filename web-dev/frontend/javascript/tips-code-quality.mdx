Code should be clean and readable. For making code presentable several convention has been made.

# Javascript Conventions

### File Naming Convention

File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (\_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that your project uses. Filenamesâ€™ extension should be .js, .ts

### Variable Naming Conventions

We use camelCase for variable and function.

Constants should be written in capital with underscores.

### Code Indenting

Use 2 space or 4 space to indent your code.

### Most commonly used practices

# Linting

Most popular linter is ESLint. By using ESList,you can automate the code quality checks and can automatically fix it with `eslint --fix`.

## using ESLint

ESLint is an open source Javascript linter. Code Linting is a type of static analysis of code. It is used to find problematic patterns. Most programming language has its own linters, sometimes it is clubbed in compilation process.

```shell
# First install the necessary ESLint dependencies
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-react-app
```

Create a new file at the root of the site name `.eslintrc.js`

```shell
# Create a config file for ESLint
touch .eslintrc.js
```

# DRY code

# SOLID
