A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

better use const, let instead of var

call stack - maintains the order of execution context

arrow function

Examples

- set time out Example

two phase helps in debuging: check

function x() {
for(var i=1; i<= 5; i++){
function close(x) {
setTimeout(function (){
console.log(x);
}, x\*1000)
}
close(i);
}
console.log("Justnotes.in");
}
