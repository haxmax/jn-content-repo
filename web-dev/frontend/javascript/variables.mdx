variable in javascript is defined using `const`, `var` and `let`.

# Hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

```js
console.log(num) // print undefined
var num = 6 // Initialization
console.log(num) //print 6
```

Variable and class declarations are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared. Note that doing so can lead to unexpected errors, and is not generally recommended. In day to day uses, always prefer const(multi thread safe), then let and var should be avoided.

## Variable hoisting

Hoisting works with variables too, so you can use a variable in code before it is declared and/or initialized.

However JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations! This means that initialization doesn't happen until the associated line of code is executed, even if the variable was originally initialized then declared, or declared and initialized in the same line.

Until that point in the execution is reached the variable has its default initialization (undefined for a variable declared using var, otherwise uninitialized).

> Note: Conceptually variable hoisting is often presented as the interpreter "splitting variable declaration and initialization, and moving (just) the declarations to the top of the code".

## let and const hoisting

Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but, unlike var, are not initialized with a default value. An exception will be thrown if a variable declared with let or const is read before it is initialized.
Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language.

```js
console.log(num) // Throws ReferenceError exception as the variable value is uninitialized
let num = 6 // Initialization
```

### Temporal dead zone (TDZ)

let variables cannot be read/written until they have been declared. If no initial value is specified on declaration, the variable is initialized with a value of undefined. Accessing the variable before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.

The variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration has completed.

```js
{
  // TDZ starts at beginning of scope
  console.log(bar) // undefined
  console.log(foo) // ReferenceError
  var bar = 1
  let foo = 2 // End of TDZ (for foo)
}
```
