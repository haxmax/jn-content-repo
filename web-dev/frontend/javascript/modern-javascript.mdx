Javascript is the language which is supported on almost every platform. You can use javascript for frontend development, backend development using nodejs, machine learning, game development. Javascript is the most loved or most hated programming language.

# Javascript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

> üí° A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.  
> For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## JavaScript Runtime

JavaScript can be executed on any device which has javascript runtime. This runtime is sometimes called `Javascript Virtual machine` or `Javascript Engines`.

e.g. Chrome, Opera and Edge is powered by runtime codenamed as `V8` and similarly `Spider Monkey` in firefox.
Nodejs has also `V8` engine and more feature like filesystem api, os api which gives more permissive than javascript running in browser.

### What can in-browser JavaScript do?

Modern JavaScript is a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.

JavaScript's capabilities greatly depend on the environment it's running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.

In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
- Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
- Remember the data on the client-side (‚Äúlocal storage‚Äù).

### What CAN'T in-browser JavaScript do?

JavaScript's abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of a user's safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user's data.

Examples of such restrictions include:

- JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.

- Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like ‚Äúdropping‚Äù a file into a browser window or selecting it via an `<input>` tag.

- There are ways to interact with camera/microphone and other devices, but they require a user's explicit permission. So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information to the NSA.

- Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).

- This is called the ‚ÄúSame Origin Policy‚Äù. To work around that, both pages must agree for data exchange and contain a special JavaScript code that handles it.

- This limitation is, again, for the user's safety. A page from http://anysite.com which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL http://gmail.com and steal information from there.

- JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that's a safety limitation.

## Different Flavors

The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone's needs. Different people want different features.

That's to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.

So recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.

Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù.

Examples of such languages:

- CoffeeScript is a ‚Äúsyntactic sugar‚Äù for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby developers like it.
- TypeScript is concentrated on adding ‚Äústrict data typing‚Äù to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
- Flow also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.
- Dart is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developed by Google.
- Brython is a Python transpiler to JavaScript that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
- Kotlin is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.

There are more. Of course, even if we use one of transpiled languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand what we're doing

### ‚û°Ô∏è What's Next?

In next you will have good understanding of language feature. Without good understanding you can't love javascript.
