# Browser Environment

Client-side JavaScript, in particular, has many APIs available to it ‚Äî these are not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code. They generally fall into two categories:

- Browser Api
  constructs built into the browser that sits on top of the JavaScript language and allows you to implement functionality more easily.
  e.g. Web audio api
- Third Party Api
  constructs built into third-party platforms.
  e.g. Twitter api to display tweets on your web pages.

In addition to above these concept are very useful

- JavaScript libraries ‚Äî Usually one or more JavaScript files containing custom functions that you can attach to your web page to speed up or enable writing common functionality. Examples include jQuery, lodash and React.

- JavaScript frameworks ‚Äî The next step up from libraries, JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular and Ember) tend to be packages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies that you install and then use to write an entire web application from scratch. The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When calling a method from a library, the developer is in control. With a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls the developer's code.

## Common browser APIs

In particular, the most common categories of browser APIs are:

DOM API : for manipulating documents loaded into the browser.

Fetch API: fetch data from the server. although older code might still use the XMLHttpRequest API.

Canvas and WebGL : APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics are widely supported in browsers. It allows you to programmatically update the pixel data contained in an HTML `<canvas>` element to create 2D and 3D scenes.

Audio and Video APIs : Just like HTMLMediaElement, the Web Audio API, and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia such as creating custom UI controls for playing audio and video, displaying text tracks like captions and subtitles along with your videos, grabbing video from your web camera to be manipulated via a canvas or displayed on someone else's computer in a web conference, or adding effects to audio tracks (such as gain, distortion, panning, etc).

Device API : It enables you to interact with device hardware: for example, accessing the device GPS to find the user's position using the Geolocation API.

Client-side storage API: It enable you to store data on the client-side, so you can create an app that will save its state between page loads, and perhaps even work when the device is offline.

## Common third-party APIs

Third-party APIs come in a large variety; some of the more popular ones that you are likely to make use of sooner or later are:

- The Twitter API: It allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.
- Map APIs : Google Maps API allows you to do all sorts of things with maps on your web pages.
- The Facebook API: It enables you to use various parts of the Facebook ecosystem to benefit your app, for example by providing app login using Facebook login, accepting in-app payments, rolling out targeted ad campaigns, etc.
- The Twilio API: It provides a framework for building voice and video call functionality into your app, sending SMS/MMS from your apps, and more.

# NodeJs

# NodeJs vs Browser

Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language.However, Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application.

Despite the fact that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make the experience radically different.

- In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

- And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.

- Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. You know which version of Node.js you will run the application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use, this is very convenient. This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript that your Node.js version supports.

- Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web you are stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.Here, You can use Babel to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser, but in Node.js, you won't need that.

- Another difference is that Node.js supports both the CommonJS and ES module systems (since Node.js v12), while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.
  > üìù In practice, this means that you can use both require() and import in Node.js, while you are limited to import in the browser.

## window, global and this

### Global object

A global object is an object that always exists in the global scope.

In JavaScript, there's always a global object defined. In a web browser, when scripts create global variables defined with the var keyword, they're created as members of the global object. (In Node.js this is not the case.) The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running. For example:

- In a web browser, any code which the script doesn't specifically start up as a background task has a `window` as its global object. This is the vast majority of JavaScript code on the Web.
- Code running in a Worker has a `WorkerGlobalScope` object as its global object.
- Scripts running under Node.js have an object called global as their global object.

> üìù Unlike var, the statements let and const do not create properties of the global object.

### window object in the Browser

The `window` object is the Global Object in the Browser. Any Global Variables or Functions can be accessed as properties of the `window` object.

Access Global Variables

```js
var foo = "foobar"
foo === window.foo // Returns: true
```

After defining a Global Variable foo, we can access its value directly from the `window` object, by using the variable name foo as a property name of the Global Object `window.foo`.

```js
//Access Global Functions
function greeting() {
  console.log("Hi!")
}
window.greeting() // It is the same as the normal invoking: greeting();
```

The example above explains how Global Functions are stored as properties in the window object. We created a Global Function called greeting, then invoked it using the window object.

### globalThis

The global `globalThis` property contains the global this value, which is akin to the global object.

Historically, accessing the global object has required different syntax in different JavaScript environments. On the web you can use `window`, `self`, or `frames` - but in Web Workers only `self` will work.

> üìù In Node.js none of these work, and you must instead use global. The `this` keyword could be used inside functions running in non‚Äìstrict mode, but `this` will be `undefined `in Modules and inside functions running in strict mode.

The `globalThis` property provides a standard way of accessing the global `this` value (and hence the global object itself) across environments. Unlike similar properties such as window and self, it's guaranteed to work in window and non-window contexts. In this way, you can access the global object in a consistent manner without having to know which environment the code is being run in. To help you remember the name, just remember that in global scope the this value is `globalThis`.

# Common Errors and exception

## undefined

In JavaScript there is Undefined (type), undefined (value) and undefined (variable).

Undefined (type) is a built-in JavaScript type.

undefined (value) is a primitive and is the sole value of the Undefined type. Any property that has not been assigned a value, assumes the undefined value. A function without a return statement, or a function with an empty return statement returns undefined. The value of an function argument is undefined when not provided.

```js
var a
typeof a //"undefined"

window.b
typeof window.b //"undefined"

var c = (function () {})()
typeof c //"undefined"

var d = (function (e) {
  return e
})()
typeof d //"undefined"
```

undefined (variable) is a global property whose initial value is undefined (value), Since its a global property we can also access it as a variable. For consistency I'm always going to call it a variable in this article.

```js
typeof undefined //"undefined"

var f = 2
f = undefined //re-assigning to undefined (variable)
typeof f //"undefined"

undefined = "hello world" //assign a string to undefined (variable)
typeof undefined //"string"

f = undefined
typeof f //"string"
f //"hello world"
```

> üìù Needless to say, re-assigning values to the undefined variable is very bad practice, and in fact its not allowed by ECMA 5 (though amongst the current set of full browser releases, only Safari enforces this).

And then there's null?
Yes, generally well understood but worth re-stating: undefined is distinct from null which is also a primitive value representing the intentional absence of a value. The only similarity between undefined and null is they both evaluate to false.

## syntax error, type error and reference error

A ReferenceError occurs when you try to use a variable that doesn't exist at all.

A TypeError occurs when the variable exists, but the operation you're trying to perform is not appropriate for the type of value it contains. In the case where the detailed message says "is not defined", this can occur if you have a variable whose value is the special undefined value, and you try to access a property of it.

Syntax error occurs while parsing JavaScript code. No code is executed in case of syntax error while in reference error and type error javascript will execute the code prior to error occurred.
