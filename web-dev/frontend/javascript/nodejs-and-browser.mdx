# Browser Environment

Client-side JavaScript, in particular, has many APIs available to it — these are not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code. They generally fall into two categories:

- Browser Api
  constructs built into the browser that sits on top of the JavaScript language and allows you to implement functionality more easily.
  e.g. Web audio api
- Third Party Api
  constructs built into third-party platforms.
  e.g. Twitter api to display tweets on your web pages.

In addition to above these concept are very useful

- JavaScript libraries — Usually one or more JavaScript files containing custom functions that you can attach to your web page to speed up or enable writing common functionality. Examples include jQuery, lodash and React.

- JavaScript frameworks — The next step up from libraries, JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular and Ember) tend to be packages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies that you install and then use to write an entire web application from scratch. The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When calling a method from a library, the developer is in control. With a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls the developer's code.

## Common browser APIs

In particular, the most common categories of browser APIs are:

DOM API : for manipulating documents loaded into the browser.

Fetch API: fetch data from the server. although older code might still use the XMLHttpRequest API.

Canvas and WebGL : APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics are widely supported in browsers. It allows you to programmatically update the pixel data contained in an HTML `<canvas>` element to create 2D and 3D scenes.

Audio and Video APIs : Just like HTMLMediaElement, the Web Audio API, and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia such as creating custom UI controls for playing audio and video, displaying text tracks like captions and subtitles along with your videos, grabbing video from your web camera to be manipulated via a canvas or displayed on someone else's computer in a web conference, or adding effects to audio tracks (such as gain, distortion, panning, etc).

Device API : It enables you to interact with device hardware: for example, accessing the device GPS to find the user's position using the Geolocation API.

Client-side storage API: It enable you to store data on the client-side, so you can create an app that will save its state between page loads, and perhaps even work when the device is offline.

## Common third-party APIs

Third-party APIs come in a large variety; some of the more popular ones that you are likely to make use of sooner or later are:

- The Twitter API: It allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.
- Map APIs : Google Maps API allows you to do all sorts of things with maps on your web pages.
- The Facebook API: It enables you to use various parts of the Facebook ecosystem to benefit your app, for example by providing app login using Facebook login, accepting in-app payments, rolling out targeted ad campaigns, etc.
- The Twilio API: It provides a framework for building voice and video call functionality into your app, sending SMS/MMS from your apps, and more.
